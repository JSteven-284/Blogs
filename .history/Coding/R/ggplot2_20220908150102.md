## **Loading Module**  

The first step is, of course, to load the module.

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## **Basic logic of ggplot2**

Here, let's talk about the basic logic of ggplot and the general template to generate a plot.  

From my understanding, ggplot just works like a 3D printer, although it will generate 2D plots.

It will load the dataframe, and then add layers based on our codes, and then add one more layer, one more layer...

Every layer could be adjusted by our codes.

So what types of layers can we use? These will be discussed later.

Let's see the general template at first:

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = <MAPPINGS>)
```
Remember, this is only the very basic template and we can extend or adjust this template in a flexible way in order to generate more useful plots based on our requirements.

## **Extensions and adjustments**

So, with the template above as a base, we can build all kinds of buildings.

Here are some common ways we could do for extension:

1. Color/Size/Shape Classification  
   This is a skill to mark the different categories of each points in a scatterplot with colors/size/shape.  

   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
   ```
2. Change color  
   This is used to change the color of **all** points, not for classification.
   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
   ```
