## **Loading Module**  

The first step is, of course, to load the module.

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## **Basic logic of ggplot2**

Here, let's talk about the basic logic of ggplot and the general template to generate a plot.  

From my understanding, ggplot just works like a 3D printer, although it will generate 2D plots.

It will load the dataframe, and then add layers based on our codes, and then add one more layer, one more layer...

Every layer could be adjusted by our codes.

So what types of layers can we use? These will be discussed later.

Let's see the general template at first:

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = <MAPPINGS>)
```
Remember, this is only the very basic template and we can extend or adjust this template in a flexible way in order to generate more useful plots based on our requirements.

## **Extensions and adjustments**

So, with the template above as a base, we can build all kinds of buildings.

Here are some common ways we could do for extension:

1. Color/Size/Shape Classification
   
   This is a skill to mark the different categories of each points in a scatterplot with colors/size/shape.  

   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
   ```
2. Change color
   
   This is used to change the color of **all** points, not for classification.  

   Notice that the position of color is out of the brackets, instead of inside brackets in the previous one.
   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
   ```

3. Facets
   
   This is also a categorical skill, but this one could work like showing multiple slides of the original plot, instead of just classifying data points in the same plot.

   There are basically two functions for that:

   The first one:

   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
     facet_wrap(~cyl)
   ```

   In this way, the original plot would be divided to n pieces, where n is the number of categories of "cyl" in this example.

   The second one:

   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
     facet_grid(drv~cyl)
   ```

   The main difference is that: This one could divide the original plot with two dimensions, while the first one could only divide it with one dimension.

   A small tip: facet_grid could also work similar to facet_wrap if we use "." to replace one of the variables in the brackets.

   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
     facet_grid(.~cyl)
   ```

   But the important thing is that, they are similar but not the same. In facet_wrap, we can add statement "nrow" to make it more comfortable, but in facet_grid we cannot do that.

   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
     facet_wrap(~cyl, nrow = 2)
   ```

4. More than scatterplot
   
   Actually, the "GEOM_FUNCTION" in the template is far more than "geom_point".

   Here are some of them that might be used commonly:

   ```
   geom_point: scatterplot
   geom_smooth: trendline
   ```

   Additionally, the "linetype/color/group" statement could be used for classification similar to color/shape/size/alpha in scatterplots.

   ```
   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))

   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))

   ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)
   ```

   Here, "show.legend" could be set to FALSE to hide the presentation of legend.
